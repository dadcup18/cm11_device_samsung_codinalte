    <string name="cpu2_desc">I am not sure what benefits this has but this allows you
    to disable the secondary cpu. It is possible that this may save battery life.
    Note: I have noticed that disabling it sometimes causes the min and max scaling
    frequency to both be set at 1000 mhz???(Experimental)</string>
    <string name="LMKNKP_desc">Low Memory Killer - Not Killable Processes: allows
